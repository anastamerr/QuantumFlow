Courtesy Update: Made the whole website Mobile friendly, Tested all parts of the website to make sure the full website is mobile friendly, hope you like it :),this increases accessibility to all user types, in terms of UI not much has changed, some new elements yes but nothing too serious in terms of UI, Oh and I also implemented dark mode into the code and i added a toggle for it, works like a charm ;) Also i have redesigned the header completely to make it look better and cleaner, all functionality still works the same

Actual Feature:
Our goal was to make users understand more about how the quantum circuits work, so we implemented two new Tabs, Our first tab is The time machine Tab, we added a new endpoint in the backend: /api/v1/snapshots, this endpoint returns the probablities in bulk, however here we use statevector instead of QASM, we take this data and display it for the users in the time machine tab, now i understand you might not understand what in bulk means, for you to understand go to the algorithms tab, import any algorithm you like, now go into our time machine tab, once inside youll find that the time machine starts at step 0, press play, you should see the gate timeline above, what this does exactly is it shows you the quantum circuit, observing how the state evolves gate by gate. Final results are the exact same as the simulation tab that was already implemented, but this way the users have more insigit on what the gates do to the state one by one, as for our second tab, its really quite straight forward, go to the lessons tab, you should find it right next to the circuit designer, when you in you should find lessons with prerequistes, you cannot skip starightforward to advanced, you need to complete the courses before it to unlock it, each lesson teaches you something new about quantum computing/circuits, to display equations we didnt really like to show it plainly, it looks bad so we used katex to display them nicely, each lesson has challenges implemented, as well as concept ideas in the theory section to ensure the user has gotten the idea, we also implemented the matrix of each gate, when you press on a gate the modal opens and shows you the matrix for it, we call it the QUANTUM LENS, you can solve each of them to progress further in the lessons, thats it! We know it isnt the most techincaly spectacular but we took a education approach with this one as anything too advanced wouldnt benefit the normal user, it would need a genius for most of the other things we couldve implmented, HOPE YOU LIKE IT

PS: If you want to add lessons of your own its pretty simple, go to this path: frontend/src/data/lessonsData.ts, at the top i defined how a lesson should be so that should make things easier for you, if you want math equations to have katex formatting you need to use stuff like this: |\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle, its annoying but its how katex formats things, THANK YOU
